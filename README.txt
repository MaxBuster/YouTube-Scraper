This is a program that I developed for an internship at CourseWorld.
It takes in input links in the linksToCrawl file and crawls them for related links on YouTube.
It also scrapes info from that link to be used to filter out the best videos.
On completion of the crawl, it write out the links it crawled, the new links it got, and the info from
	crawled links.

The program can be run from the Main class in crawler.
